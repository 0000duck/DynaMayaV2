# DynaMaya
Dynamo for Maya

This is the initial public release of DynaMaya, Dynamo for Maya

This project has been an internal project for the past 3 years and the main workflow in my firm CERVER Design Studio for many project. 
I will greatly expand this description as well as provide examples and other fun stuff but for now please note

<b>This is work</b> in progress. the stable build of DynaMaya is built on Dynamo Core 1.3 and in the coming week this will become stable as well but is early stages of converting to Dynamo core 2.0. this current branch is built on Core 2.1. There are still a lot of broken things as i work through the new 2.0 API changes as well as taking some time since i broke everything anyway to add a few more features.
