// in AssemblyVersionInfo.cs so that it can be easily incremented by the
// automated build process.




// By default, the "Product version" shown in the file properties window is
// the same as the value specified for AssemblyFileVersionAttribute.
// Set AssemblyInformationalVersionAttribute to be the same as
// AssemblyVersionAttribute so that the "Product version" in the file
// properties window matches the version displayed in the GAC shell extension.

// Version information for an assembly consists of the following four values:

//      Major Version
//      Minor Version 
//      Build Number
//      Revision

// You can specify all the values or you can default the Build and Revision Numbers 
// by using the '*' as shown below:
